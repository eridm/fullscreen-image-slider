# Full Screen Image Slider

  Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wherein you can display a set of images and view them by clicking on side arrows. <br>
It was created as a part of the programmer's in-depth studying with Front-End Development, and at the same time, another objective of this project is for the developer
to deconstruct the source code, and understand the concepts behind it.
